1
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:19,733
Three things are
important in History.

2
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,335
First of all, numbers...

3
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:23,970
secondly, numbers...

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,961
and thirdly, numbers.

5
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:29,876
This means, for example...

6
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:32,179
the blacks in South Africa...

7
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:35,415
are bound to win some day...

8
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:40,011
while Nonh American blacks
will probably never make it.

9
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:44,715
Histoy is not a moral science.

10
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,353
Legality, compassion, justice...

11
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:53,657
such notions are
foreign to histoy.

12
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:46,806
lnterview with Dominique
Starnaud, by Diane Léonard...

13
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:48,967
for, Writers Today.

14
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:55,582
You're Chairperson of
the Histoy Depanment...

15
00:03:55,582 --> 00:04:00,921
and you've just published
Changing Concepts of Happiness.

16
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:02,956
Can you tell us about it?

17
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:07,827
lt's my premise that the
concept of personal happiness...

18
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:12,399
permeates the literature
of a nation or civilization...

19
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,068
as its influence wanes.

20
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,704
What do you mean by
''personal happiness''?

21
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:21,074
The expectation
of receiving...

22
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,310
instant gratification
in daily life...

23
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,813
and that this
gratification constitutes...

24
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:29,616
the normative
parameter of existence.

25
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:32,551
Can you give us
a concrete example?

26
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:38,358
Take marriage, for instance.

27
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:40,360
ln stable societies, marriage

28
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,262
is a mode of
economic exchange...

29
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,030
or a unit of production.

30
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,665
Meaning?

31
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:48,268
The success of a
marriage doesn't depend

32
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:52,272
on the personal happiness
of the 2 individuals.

33
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:55,542
The issue never even comes up.

34
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:58,445
A developing society
places greater imponance...

35
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:01,214
on the collective good,
orfuture happiness...

36
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:03,648
than on personal satisfaction.

37
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:07,520
ln Rome, for example...

38
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,023
the idea of conjugal
love first prevails

39
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,292
in the 3rd centuy,
under Diocletian...

40
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:14,694
as the Empire is collapsing.

41
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:18,932
And in Europe, Rousseau's
idea ofhappiness...

42
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,867
ushered in the
French Revolution.

43
00:05:23,136 --> 00:05:25,105
So l pose the question:

44
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:27,807
ls the frantic drive
for personal happiness...

45
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,976
we see in society today...

46
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:33,947
linked to the decline
of the American empire...

47
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,416
as we are now experiencing it?

48
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,019
How's that?

49
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,322
l need another 5 minutes.
Milan Kundera didn't show.

50
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:43,890
Just stretch it out.

51
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,291
How?

52
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:49,625
Social disintegration,
decay of the elites, you know.

53
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:57,470
Strange that she barely
mentions women in her book.

54
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,872
lt wasn't her subject.

55
00:05:58,872 --> 00:05:59,973
Still...

56
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:01,574
To ignore it...

57
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:06,179
Who'd want to equate feminine
powerwith social decay?

58
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:10,050
But women's rise to power has
always been linked to decline.

59
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,918
lt's symptomatic.

60
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,753
You can tell herthat later.

61
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,015
Thanks!

62
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,858
Speaking of feminine power...

63
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:22,929
you should see the
Vietnamese girl in my class!

64
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:25,665
With Orientals,
l have this feeling...

65
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,635
they're giving my money
to their sick brother.

66
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:31,934
l can't imagine them
ontologically perverse.

67
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,403
I Telephone ringing ]

68
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:45,118
Sebastian broke the
window in the back door.

69
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:49,255
l've covered it, but
should l call in a repairman?

70
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:50,890
I l'll do it Monday. ]

71
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,361
And my car's dead.
lt must be the staner.

72
00:06:55,361 --> 00:07:00,233
Sylvaine had a fit 'cause
l couldn't drive herto ballet.

73
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,668
I Uhhuh. ]

74
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:04,671
Dominique and Diane
aren't here yet.

75
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:08,408
So don't wory if
we're a little late.

76
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,777
No problem, we'll wait.

77
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:13,245
Danielle wants
to speak to Pierre.

78
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:21,621
l love you.

79
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:22,956
Really?

80
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,257
You?

81
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:25,391
I Me? ]

82
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:26,826
You still love me?

83
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,794
Yes, of course.

84
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:33,227
You're scared to say
it because of Rémy, eh?

85
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:37,128
I See you later. ]

86
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,910
Can we help?

87
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,012
After l've prepared the trout.

88
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,843
The shallots please.

89
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:01,027
My back's really huning.

90
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,695
You should take a swim.

91
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,425
The water's so cold,
and l swim badly.

92
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,393
Making love is the only
exercise l really enjoy.

93
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:15,235
Turn over.

94
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:30,423
Oh, to be slim,
young and attractive...

95
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,625
l'm forever on a diet.

96
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,228
l weigh myself evey morning.

97
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:38,857
l'm terrified of getting flabby.

98
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,035
My problem is...

99
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:43,900
l was born in the wrong era.

100
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:47,031
l was made to be fat.

101
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,810
My grandmother,

102
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,712
never did anything
more strenuous...

103
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,547
than play the organ in church.

104
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:58,117
She was an enormous
woman who loved to eat...

105
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:00,881
and drank vermouth
with her sugar donuts.

106
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,493
ln those days, men
liked theirwomen big.

107
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:09,429
There's no vesiga, l suppose.

108
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:12,098
Use the tapioca.

109
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:16,703
There's a Polish store
that sometimes has vesiga.

110
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,873
But it's way out in Brossard!

111
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:25,378
l took Leni Eisenbach to a
Chinese restaurant in Brossard.

112
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:27,180
ln Brossard?

113
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,013
ls there a good Chinese
restaurant in Brossard?

114
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,121
What?

115
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,021
Hand me the parsley.

116
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:40,560
l was still married then.

117
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,629
l don't get it.

118
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,799
Visual idiots! Perhaps you
should draw him a picture.

119
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,668
So, tell me.

120
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:53,306
A month before, l'd invited a
student to Delmo's for seafood.

121
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:57,277
Naturally, intending to
screw her madly afterwards.

122
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:59,279
Never changes.

123
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,549
Afriend of my
wife's spotted us.

124
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,652
She had just separated.

125
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:08,488
Her husband was
cheating on her of course.

126
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:09,989
She hated men.

127
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:12,158
Familiartune.

128
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:16,462
At 4 am. when l say the
faculty meeting ended late...

129
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:20,633
my wife asks me if
the oysters were fresh.

130
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,794
Horror ofhorrors!

131
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,469
This explains why married
men frequent the suburbs.

132
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:32,545
l discovered amyl
nitrite in Brossard.

133
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:33,746
What's that?

134
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,548
Drug for hean patients...

135
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:38,051
dilates the blood
vessels instantly.

136
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:40,451
You had a hean
attack, in Brossard?

137
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,891
l'd picked up 2 girls
hitching to New York.

138
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:46,326
Couldn't pass them by.

139
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:47,623
Not at night!

140
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,363
So l paid fortheir motel.

141
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,398
Ah, Christian charity!

142
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,367
lt had its rewards!

143
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,803
They offered to sleep with me.

144
00:10:56,803 --> 00:10:58,638
Two kind souls.

145
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,731
Lovely bodies too.

146
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:07,113
One of them placed a tiny
pill on the night table.

147
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,881
ls that the chicken stock?

148
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,783
Yeah, and get the velouté.

149
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:15,686
She told me to take the
pill 15 seconds before coming.

150
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,592
Amyl nitrite just
before orgasm...

151
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:23,162
Absolute ecstasy...
St. John of the Cross.

152
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,732
But it ages your hean years.

153
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:28,334
l'm such a jerk...

154
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:31,770
l was so excited,
l forgot to take it.

155
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:35,266
l brought it home...

156
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:41,547
and took it the next
night, with my wife.

157
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:45,574
Told her it was a test for
the school of pharmacology!

158
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:16,883
There's a diver in the pool.

159
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:19,685
He must be from the club.

160
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:21,187
You're shivering!

161
00:12:21,187 --> 00:12:23,089
The water's freezing.

162
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,489
Go take a sauna.

163
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,529
What're those?

164
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:30,797
What?

165
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:32,331
Those marks.

166
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:35,198
Nothing... from my judo class.

167
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,362
Judo?

168
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:45,508
So l told my daughter.
She's insanely jealous.

169
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:53,219
l'm having a weird
affairwith this guy.

170
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:54,987
Unbelievable.

171
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:57,356
Someone l met in a bar.

172
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,058
What does he do?

173
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:01,694
l prefer not to know.

174
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:05,965
For openers, he said it was
time l met a man like him...

175
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:07,398
a real man.

176
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,612
He's never made
love to me normally...

177
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,447
always from behind...

178
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:22,971
like a man.

179
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:28,413
Before him, l
couldn't stand that.

180
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:32,492
The first few times
he pulled on my hair...

181
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,426
like a mane.

182
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,499
Then...

183
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,534
he staned spanking me...

184
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:44,503
on my ass and thighs.

185
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:48,166
Next it was his leather belt.

186
00:13:50,943 --> 00:13:53,312
Then he began...

187
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:56,406
tying me to the radiator...

188
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:01,376
ln more and more
degrading positions.

189
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:05,149
l had never come like that.

190
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:07,955
But l have to stop.

191
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:10,587
lt's getting dangerous.

192
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:13,326
You're afraid ofhim?

193
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:18,869
No, it's me l'm afraid of.

194
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:27,577
l'm the one who always
wants to go funher.

195
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:30,104
l'm the one in control.

196
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,819
l've neverfelt so powerful.

197
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:36,515
The power of the
victim is incredible.

198
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:44,964
He's totally dependent on me.

199
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:47,867
lt's got nothing to
do with wife beating.

200
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:51,667
lt's a game that has
fixed rules but no limits.

201
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,841
We could even kill each other.

202
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,611
The strangest pan
is, l don't love him.

203
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:00,246
He knows...

204
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:03,010
how to get right into me.

205
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:08,487
You lie through yourteeth,
that's what saves you.

206
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,390
What else can one do?

207
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,060
Lying is the basis
of all love affairs...

208
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,596
of our vey social existence.

209
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,231
Refusing to lie

210
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:20,666
would be much the same as

211
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:25,871
telling an eminent colleague
from Laval University...

212
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:27,640
who's devoted years

213
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,376
to the histoy of
Catholicism in Canada...

214
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,545
that he can take...

215
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,347
Bishop Bourget's sermons...

216
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:37,049
roll them vey tightly...

217
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,318
and slowly shove
them up his ass.

218
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:42,151
Not Bishop Bourget's sermons!

219
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:47,493
lnstead...

220
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:50,496
you shake his hand
warmly and say...

221
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,231
''Vey impressive!''

222
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:54,267
''Outstanding research!''

223
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:55,668
Think so?

224
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,370
''Brilliant fact checking!''

225
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,203
Really, gentlemen,
you're embarrassing me!

226
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,276
Same with women.

227
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:05,678
''Your hairdo makes
you years younger.''

228
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:07,580
''l thought about you all day.''

229
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,282
''Wanted to call.''

230
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:11,614
''We can still be friends.''

231
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,853
l couldn't endure a separation.

232
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:15,514
The screaming,
threats of suicide...

233
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:40,379
finding an apanment,
fighting overthe furniture.

234
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:44,076
l knew a couple who even
divided up their spice jars.

235
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:49,689
lt's easierto stay together.

236
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,157
Couples renovate their houses...

237
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:56,462
crosscounty ski
to Povoknituk...

238
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:59,031
Or scourthe sex shops for

239
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:01,701
chains and whatever.

240
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,403
They swap wives in suburbia.

241
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:08,635
Anything to escape
the years ofboredom.

242
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,404
Love, the kind

243
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,914
that makes your hean race...

244
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,007
makes you send flowers...

245
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,444
lasts 2 years at best.

246
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:24,082
Then the compromises begin.

247
00:17:25,091 --> 00:17:27,393
Life's a compromise.

248
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,628
We've been married years...

249
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,631
and still have wonderful times.

250
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:34,500
You don't have kids.

251
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,195
lt's not the same.

252
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:40,439
l want to be with
mine evey day...

253
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,873
not evey otherweekend.

254
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,312
You're flushed.

255
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:49,415
Oh...? My sauce won't thicken.

256
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,849
l divorced for
purely physical reasons.

257
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:55,580
l was scared to
death of the phone.

258
00:17:57,323 --> 00:17:59,725
When you have affairs...

259
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:02,828
the poorthings are
bound to fall in love.

260
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:04,227
lt was awful...

261
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:10,331
knowing one day, one of
them would call me at home.

262
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:14,596
Evey time the phone rang...

263
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:18,868
my hean skipped a beat.

264
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:24,717
lt's been years now.

265
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:27,653
With Danielle, it's different.

266
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:30,656
Still, when the
phone rings at night...

267
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:34,193
I Telephone ring ]

268
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,525
l panic, totally.

269
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:46,505
Who is it?

270
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,302
Awoman.

271
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:57,249
Oh, hi mom.

272
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:58,717
The young lady who answered...?

273
00:18:58,717 --> 00:18:59,706
She's a student.

274
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,965
A girl called you last night.

275
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:14,733
She spoke English.

276
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,257
Oh yeah?

277
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,840
l didn't understand much.

278
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,569
Guess not.

279
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,806
She said her name was Barbara.

280
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:37,650
Must be the girl from
the conference in San Diego.

281
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:45,487
She sends...

282
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:48,795
''a warm kiss''.

283
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:51,897
Oh?

284
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,441
She's a lovely girl.

285
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,102
Terrific organizer.

286
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,976
Barbara Michalski!

287
00:20:11,223 --> 00:20:13,626
She'd done her
Ph.D. at San Diego...

288
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:16,925
on the impact of working
women in Chicano families.

289
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,925
She was brilliant.

290
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,670
That's what seduction's about...

291
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,339
not big breasts or long legs.

292
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,241
lt's in the mind.

293
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,644
We were together only days.

294
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,846
We went camping in the Baja.

295
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:36,982
l knew nothing about psychology.

296
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:39,418
So at night,
before we made love...

297
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:43,222
she'd tell me about
R.D. Laing, antipsychiaty...

298
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:45,357
so many things.

299
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:48,093
l could've listened to
herfor nights on end.

300
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:49,560
I Knock! Knock! ]

301
00:20:51,564 --> 00:20:52,690
Hi, Rémy.

302
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,499
Sory l'm early.

303
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:00,105
Am l disturbing you?

304
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:01,907
Not at all.

305
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:03,409
What are you up to?

306
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,010
Some filing.

307
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:06,412
What's in that file?

308
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:07,546
Nothing.

309
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,582
lt's on Shiite
factions in Lebanon.

310
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:10,883
Are you sure?

311
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:12,284
Why Lulu...

312
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:15,220
l'm as clear as spring water.

313
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,189
Yeah, transparent even.

314
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,191
Wholesome as fresh bread.

315
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,056
What became ofher?

316
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,422
l don't know.

317
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:29,368
We used to phone each other.

318
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,359
Then she disappeared.

319
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:35,840
Probably married
some dumb Mexican.

320
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,046
Whenever l'm in the libray...

321
00:21:41,046 --> 00:21:44,950
l look for her name
in the psychology journals.

322
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,248
l'll probably
never see her again.

323
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,213
l think about her a lot.

324
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:56,962
How tragic!

325
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:08,597
What're you thinking?

326
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:12,569
l was thinking
how happy we are.

327
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:20,119
l'm not completely naive.

328
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,988
l'm sure Rémy has flings
now and then, on his trips.

329
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:28,549
But at home he's good.

330
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:33,165
The one time he
wasn't, l was with him.

331
00:22:33,165 --> 00:22:35,224
So l don't wory.

332
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,404
Meaning?

333
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,429
l don't know ifl should tell.

334
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:44,576
We'd heard about a doctor...

335
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:46,879
an old school buddy of Rémy's...

336
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:50,246
who organized rather
unusual panies.

337
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:54,286
He had invited us...

338
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,755
and we decided to go.

339
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:59,425
What was it like?

340
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:02,494
There were a dozen couples...

341
00:23:02,494 --> 00:23:05,064
professional people mostly.

342
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:07,532
A psychiatrist too.

343
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,661
People from about 30 to 50.

344
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,541
What happened?

345
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,310
lt was a bit strange.

346
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,413
First, they waited
for eveyone to arrive.

347
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:25,713
Then we went to the basement.

348
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:28,420
lt was spacious...

349
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,856
with thick carpets,
lots of pillows...

350
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,591
soft lighting...

351
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:35,355
They showed a porno video.

352
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:40,798
People began to dance.

353
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:46,138
lt wasn't really dancing...

354
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:49,575
more like venical foreplay.

355
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:52,945
Then suddenly eveyone
was making love...

356
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:56,014
all overthe house,
in the rooms upstairs.

357
00:23:56,014 --> 00:23:58,150
You too?

358
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,685
Yeah.

359
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:02,054
But just once.

360
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:04,523
l wasn't what you'd call...

361
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,548
the life of the pany.

362
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:10,162
Rémy was more active.

363
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:12,664
l saw him with 2 women.

364
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:14,996
Who did you fuck?

365
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,095
l don't even know.

366
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:22,172
You don't talk much.

367
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:30,916
The man making love to
me was taking his time...

368
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:32,384
That's good.

369
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:34,653
Yeah, it's just
that his wife...

370
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:38,257
must've hit on a
premature ejaculator.

371
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:40,953
Because she arrives...

372
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:45,998
Charles...

373
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:47,299
What?

374
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,569
Aren't you being
a little slow?

375
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,059
Thérése, please!

376
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:54,306
Come on!

377
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,603
Come on!

378
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:59,378
Are you serious?

379
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,606
l swear!

380
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,116
Are you enjoying him?

381
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:05,184
Thérése!

382
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:06,218
Uhhuh.

383
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:07,252
Coming dear.

384
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:10,278
Alright, see you later.

385
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:14,226
So he staned in for real.

386
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:18,230
l did my best to help him.

387
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,722
You shouted,
''More, more, more!''

388
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:26,104
Let's say l kept it to...

389
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:28,307
heavy panting.

390
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,843
Anyway, finally it worked.

391
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:34,847
He had his little orgasm
and went off to find his wife.

392
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,337
Did you come?

393
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:39,476
Well, no.

394
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:47,888
He didn't know me.

395
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:51,530
l'm not like you, Diane...

396
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,465
l was doing it mainly for Rémy.

397
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,270
What do you mean,
not like me?

398
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,505
Well, it was...

399
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:02,274
for married couples.

400
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:04,042
Married?

401
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:05,669
That's right.

402
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:09,047
These people...

403
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:13,151
are absolutely faithful,
do everything together.

404
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:16,822
For me it was a way...

405
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,224
of showing our love.

406
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:21,593
Have you evertried it?

407
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:26,298
Wife swapping panies,
orgies, that son of thing?

408
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:30,802
l never mix my marriage
with my sex life.

409
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:33,038
l may cheat on Louise,

410
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,939
but l know she's the one for me.

411
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:38,443
Yes?

412
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:41,313
Diane's not around?

413
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:42,803
Not yet.

414
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,087
Which is her place?

415
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:51,156
The one in back.

416
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:52,646
Right next to mine.

417
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:57,154
The door's probably locked.

418
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:01,298
l'll go see.

419
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:09,237
Not bad!

420
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:12,436
Yourtype, eh?

421
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:15,580
lt's asking fortrouble.

422
00:27:41,673 --> 00:27:44,242
l was in love with
someone like him.

423
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:45,937
lt lasted 6 months.

424
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:51,777
He was killed.

425
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:54,443
Motorcycle accident.

426
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,260
That's when l began cruising.

427
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,831
l'd be cruising evey
night ifl could.

428
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,399
l thought you were.

429
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,991
Not anymore.

430
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:12,228
l can't teach the next day.

431
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:16,837
The only time l feel
alive is when l'm cruising.

432
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:35,421
lt's incredible, l become...

433
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,626
crazed...

434
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:40,899
electrified...

435
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:42,234
l know the feeling.

436
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:44,102
But for me it's dangerous.

437
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:46,593
Afriend was stabbed
in the shower.

438
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:50,975
l can't help it.

439
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:54,545
Some nights ljust
have to fuck someone...

440
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:57,416
Anyone.

441
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,850
lt doesn't matter.

442
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,648
Like an alley
cat on the prowl...

443
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:07,025
The urge is overwhelming.

444
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:09,127
l'm always being robbed.

445
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:13,791
Guys take off with
records, wine, my watch.

446
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:19,298
l'm not physically brave...

447
00:29:20,972 --> 00:29:22,874
but when it hits...

448
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:26,211
l can set out at 4 am.
on an expedition...

449
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:29,237
through the saunas
of Los Angeles...

450
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:33,545
orthe heaviest bars in
St. Pauli in Hamburg.

451
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:41,054
That's why l live alone.

452
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:44,821
l never know how
the day will end.

453
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:47,799
Even if nothing happens...

454
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,267
the possibility still exists.

455
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:55,073
Knowing l have to be home at 6,

456
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:58,143
'cause the old lady
has supperwaiting...

457
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:00,043
would kill me.

458
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,647
The old lady orthe old man.

459
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,683
Same thing.

460
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:07,352
l like knowing
supper is ready...

461
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:09,554
and stopping off
on the way home.

462
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:12,591
When l'm in love,
l become monogamous.

463
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:13,922
lt lasts a while...

464
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,262
then the beast rears its head.

465
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:19,931
l turn into a public menace!

466
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,661
l swear, they should lock me up.

467
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:27,072
l once visited a brothel...

468
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,267
on the way to my mistress.

469
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:32,511
Ty explaining that to a woman.

470
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:34,012
Oh damn.

471
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:35,113
What?

472
00:30:35,113 --> 00:30:36,281
We're out of eggs.

473
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:37,805
l've got some...

474
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:41,453
the plastic kind
from the village.

475
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,488
l couldn't buy any in the city.

476
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:44,819
They'll do.

477
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,525
lt was locked?

478
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:54,590
She shouldn't be long.

479
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,674
l'm not like you guys.

480
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:05,143
l don't need to fuck
a new girl evey day.

481
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:07,546
l didn't either at your age.

482
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:12,517
But you can't correct
our students' papers forever.

483
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,314
You still have to do your Ph.D.

484
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,789
You'll want to buy
an apanment...

485
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,758
maybe a county house.

486
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:22,226
lt keeps your mind occupied.

487
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:30,030
Perhaps you dream of
writing an imponant book.

488
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:35,572
l know l'll never be
a Toynbee or a Braudel.

489
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:39,073
All l have left is...

490
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:41,379
sex...

491
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:42,881
or love.

492
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,508
What's the difference?

493
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:47,781
l don't know what's left for me.

494
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,254
That's why age leads to vice.

495
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,760
l don't have
all that ambition.

496
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,456
ljust want to be happy.

497
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,831
l need some water.

498
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:12,034
Would you like mineral water?

499
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,177
Doesn't yourtap work?

500
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:34,532
Are you on medication?

501
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:36,227
A home remedy.

502
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:40,631
lt's real strong.

503
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,604
l take multivitamins.

504
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:47,003
Must be good foryou.

505
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,385
l'm gonna split.

506
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:54,753
What about Diane?

507
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:56,186
l'll be back.

508
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:29,054
Wittgenstein wrote that...

509
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:34,151
our only cenainty is the
ability to act with the body.

510
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:37,729
lfl'm in love, l get hard.

511
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:42,167
lfl don't get hard,
l'm not in love.

512
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:45,036
Otherwise, you're
deceiving yourself.

513
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:49,336
Like a woman who says
she still loves you...

514
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:52,811
when she's as dy
as sandpaper...

515
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:56,247
and you remember
how she'd be dripping...

516
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,943
if you so much as
kissed her on the neck.

517
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:31,282
Roger had me sleep
with his best friend.

518
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:35,120
ln fact, for 6 months
we all slept together.

519
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,223
l can recommend it
2 mouths, 4 hands...

520
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:40,350
lt's not as easy as all that.

521
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,262
l tried it in Maninique
with 2 young blacks.

522
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:47,665
As soon as they opened
their mouths it was over.

523
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:49,801
''Madam not know Maatinique...

524
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:52,702
if no sleep with Maatiniquers.''

525
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,696
They show me a gold bracelet...

526
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,868
''A gift from her
HonourJudge Thibodeau.''

527
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,513
They're so macho!

528
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:02,747
l'm paying...

529
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:04,738
but they tell me what to do.

530
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:10,655
White woman on her knees
before the black boy's cock.

531
00:35:10,655 --> 00:35:12,157
Not your style, eh?

532
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:14,159
Not exactly.

533
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,361
l prefer African blacks.

534
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,829
Like Mustafa?

535
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:19,297
No thanks!

536
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:21,733
Men who drool over me...

537
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:24,235
l don't know,
Africans are somehow...

538
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:25,537
warmer.

539
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,505
Of course they're polygamous...

540
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:28,802
You get used to it.

541
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:31,735
What do you mean?

542
00:35:32,744 --> 00:35:34,336
Well...

543
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,287
lt's not 4:30!

544
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:43,652
lt's 4:30?

545
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:45,924
Shit!

546
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:48,586
l told Louise l'd meet her at 4.

547
00:35:51,596 --> 00:35:55,123
l wanted to buy the kids
Christmas presents.

548
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:57,969
My shin!

549
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,027
The den.

550
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,842
My sweater?

551
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,173
On the sofa.

552
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:07,474
Your ring!

553
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:13,548
lt was great.
See you tomorrow.

554
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:19,357
l always come
back to ltalians.

555
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,348
They're impossible, but...

556
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,468
Ah, my first visits to ltaly...

557
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:33,062
l was continually being robbed.

558
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,574
The guys would
take my passpon...

559
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:39,236
my traveller's
cheques, my watch...

560
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:44,649
But there was lots of amore.

561
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:49,018
Such simple souls, they
shout 'Mamma' when they come.

562
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:55,727
The first time
a man shouted 'Mamma'...

563
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:58,730
l thought his
mother had come in.

564
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,096
l wanted to hide underthe bed.

565
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:10,174
You're sure
you don't have AlDS?

566
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:14,577
lt's 2 to 5 years incubation.
Like to test my saliva?

567
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:17,715
You're not scared?

568
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,617
lt's pan of the pleasure.

569
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:22,220
Anyway, disease
is pan of sex.

570
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,622
Ever heard women
talk about their insides?

571
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:27,592
The fibromas,
vaginitus, salpingitis...

572
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:28,960
Chlamydia...

573
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,228
spirochaetes...

574
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:31,629
Herpes...

575
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,765
soft chancres!

576
00:37:33,765 --> 00:37:35,033
To think...

577
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:38,770
you actually dip
your cocks in that!

578
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,471
Our cocks... ourtongues...

579
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:42,473
Staphylococcus aureus!

580
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:44,809
Come on, that's in the throat.

581
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:46,377
My poor boy...

582
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:50,048
it can spread ever so easily from
herthroat to your pecker.

583
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:55,119
Then its hello urethritis
with staphylococcus aureus!

584
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,457
And the hospital on an empty
stomach once a week for months!

585
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:01,192
Explain that to yourwife!

586
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:04,462
You can't make love,
leave forwork at 7...

587
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:05,563
once a week.

588
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,031
Without breakfast.

589
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:09,667
You can't drink
because of the antibiotics.

590
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:11,736
Not to mention the stains...

591
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,806
you ty to wash
out of the sheets...

592
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:17,842
while yourwife's in the shower.

593
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:20,044
lt's not as bad as AlDS.

594
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:23,810
Otherwise homosexuality
would be paradise on eanh.

595
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:28,086
They're already better
dressed, more cultivated...

596
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:31,122
They're gayertoo.
Such a sense ofhumour.

597
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:35,326
They're better cooks,
just look at his dough.

598
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,428
Yes, but l'm going to Hell.

599
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,197
Save me a seat.

600
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:41,232
They have friends all over.

601
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:45,870
When a man tells me, ''l stayed
with friends in Amsterdam...''

602
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,939
l know he's gay

603
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:51,009
My friends are married
and have children...

604
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:52,844
their apanments are crammed.

605
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:57,649
And my old girlfriends are with
men who don't want me around.

606
00:38:57,649 --> 00:39:00,351
They're even better looking.

607
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:02,387
That's the worst.

608
00:39:02,387 --> 00:39:06,524
Here are your 2
classic hetero's...

609
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:11,295
overweight, noses too
long, our complexions are...

610
00:39:11,295 --> 00:39:12,284
Ravaged!

611
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:15,500
So the question is...

612
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,003
are we hetero because
we're not goodlooking...

613
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:22,200
orwould our looks
improve if we were gay?

614
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:25,677
Serious matter.

615
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:30,481
Atruly superb teenage
boy looking in the mirror

616
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:31,549
must think...

617
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:33,518
''This is too good for a woman!''

618
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:34,619
Exactly!

619
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:35,687
Yes, but...

620
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:37,177
the moustache.

621
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:39,712
Kissing a moustache...

622
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:43,588
You have to get to them
before they have one.

623
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,994
He's a worse perven than me!

624
00:39:47,031 --> 00:39:50,768
l'm not talking about myself.
Really, l'm no pederast, but...

625
00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:52,870
aesthetically speaking...

626
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,140
nothing compares to the
ass of a 12yearold boy...

627
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,944
Not the Sistine Chapel
orthe B Minor Mass.

628
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:02,980
At 12, a boy's ass is sublime.

629
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,050
By that age, girls
have gone flabby.

630
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,852
Matter of taste.

631
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:12,123
A guy in a bar once said to me,
''Honey, a hole is a hole.''

632
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:14,525
Should've called me in.

633
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,390
He may be right.

634
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:21,028
Plus the joy ofliving with
someone who doesn't menstruate.

635
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:26,469
Louise turns into a
monster4 or 5 days a month.

636
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:30,942
l nearly strangled her
one Sunday, last winter.

637
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:34,078
There had been
a huge snow storm.

638
00:40:34,078 --> 00:40:38,716
l wanted to take my carto buy
the papers, but l got stuck.

639
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:41,853
Of course, l'm
blocking her car...

640
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:44,122
so she can't go to
hertennis lesson.

641
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:46,758
She made an ugly scene...

642
00:40:46,758 --> 00:40:48,893
''You should have
let me out first.

643
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:51,362
You never could
drive in the snow!''

644
00:40:51,362 --> 00:40:54,559
l should move out a
week before her period.

645
00:40:56,167 --> 00:41:00,671
The Sunday Times is sacred,
of course, snowstorm or not.

646
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:05,009
Naturally he gets stuck, which
means l can't go to tennis.

647
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:09,447
My last chance to see François
for a month! l was furious!

648
00:41:09,447 --> 00:41:11,549
François was the tennis pro?

649
00:41:11,549 --> 00:41:15,052
Yeah, he was going
to some tournament.

650
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:17,789
l was climbing the walls!

651
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:21,492
The fact l couldn't say
why, made it even worse!

652
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:24,061
How long had
the affair lasted?

653
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:25,797
lt wasn't an affair.

654
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,431
Nothing had happened.

655
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:30,889
But that Sunday l
felt something might.

656
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:34,071
That's what made me mad...

657
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:36,801
l hadn't done anything wrong.

658
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:01,991
l wasn't sure when he'd be back.

659
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,269
Finally l got my nerve up.

660
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:07,004
l called.

661
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:09,871
l know you're not
supposed to, but...

662
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:15,046
His daughter answered.

663
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:17,207
He lives with his 14yearold.

664
00:42:18,282 --> 00:42:21,251
l heard him ask who it was.

665
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,654
She said, ''Probably
one of your mistresses.''

666
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,353
l hung up.

667
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,363
Neverwent back.

668
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,332
Well, l did once.

669
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:35,959
l didn't go in.

670
00:42:45,343 --> 00:42:47,334
l saw him with a woman.

671
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:50,047
Ayoung woman.

672
00:42:50,047 --> 00:42:52,106
At least you still had Rémy.

673
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:56,520
When you live alone,
you get used to it.

674
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,318
Your sex drive vanishes.

675
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,756
You stop thinking about it.

676
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:08,799
Then an old lover comes along...

677
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:11,461
or someone else by accident.

678
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:20,309
Can't you sleep?

679
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:25,012
What is it?

680
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:29,083
l want to sleep in my own bed.

681
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:34,086
lt's snowing.

682
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,287
l like sleeping alone.

683
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,928
Me too, but not all the time.

684
00:43:56,447 --> 00:43:57,782
Now you're awake...

685
00:43:57,782 --> 00:43:59,317
you want it again.

686
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:02,820
But he's had his
fun, so he's gone.

687
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,380
Leaving you with
asymptomatic gonorrhea.

688
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:08,225
Nice, eh.

689
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:12,296
All that, just to have some
creature to warm your bed.

690
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:14,662
l'd stoop to
almost anything...

691
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:17,600
for a warm body Sunday morning.

692
00:44:18,602 --> 00:44:20,471
Though you don't
even need a man.

693
00:44:20,471 --> 00:44:22,139
l cuddle with my daughter...

694
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:23,374
We smooch.

695
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:25,710
How old is she?

696
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,044
Twelve.

697
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:29,447
Aren't you worried...?

698
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:31,972
l mean, psychologically...

699
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:35,052
No.

700
00:44:35,052 --> 00:44:37,989
ln therapy, after
my depression...

701
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:40,424
l was afraid l was a lesbian.

702
00:44:40,424 --> 00:44:42,093
Why afraid?

703
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:43,928
l don't know...

704
00:44:43,928 --> 00:44:46,263
Have you ever
slept with a woman?

705
00:44:46,263 --> 00:44:48,288
Yeah, a few times.

706
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:52,669
You too?

707
00:44:53,704 --> 00:44:55,006
Uhhuh.

708
00:44:55,006 --> 00:44:56,374
God!

709
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:58,672
l'm always so scared
ofbeing abnormal.

710
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:06,584
lsn't that a lot?

711
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:08,652
We'll send some to Mustafa...

712
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:10,210
in Ouagadougou.

713
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:13,624
They love
coulibiac in the Sahel.

714
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:16,427
With sour cream
and Roben Mondavi.

715
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:18,529
You're disgusting.

716
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:20,297
Not at all!

717
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:23,834
No one's more
devoted to the Negro.

718
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:27,772
l personally took Mustafa
down to the strip last Thursday.

719
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:28,939
When did he leave?

720
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:30,041
The next day.

721
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:31,409
That was the problem.

722
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:35,012
ln 2 months he hadn't
laid a single Canadian.

723
00:45:35,012 --> 00:45:37,181
He was feeling so dejected.

724
00:45:37,181 --> 00:45:39,877
Don't you mean erected?

725
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:45,456
Our coeds must be losing
interest in the Third World.

726
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:48,125
Anyway, l took him
to St. Lawrence Street

727
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,128
We spotted this
gorgeous blonde,

728
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:52,830
tallerthan me...

729
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,162
done up in red silk.

730
00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:00,104
Mustafa was licking his chops.

731
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:02,273
l negotiated for him.

732
00:46:02,273 --> 00:46:04,798
Wouldn't want him to
squander UNESCO funds.

733
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:08,813
Evening, Miss.
A pleasure to meet you.

734
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:13,182
l'd like to introduce a
friend. A great guy, but shy.

735
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:16,687
He's a brilliant historian.

736
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:18,951
A specialist on Mossy culture.

737
00:46:21,058 --> 00:46:22,560
Think ofit...

738
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,329
as your contribution
to African relief...

739
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:27,661
like singing in
We Are the World.

740
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,568
Get the picture?

741
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:32,336
Okay with me...

742
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:34,566
but your Negro's
in for a surprise.

743
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:36,932
Oh boy!

744
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:40,544
That's not quite
what we had in mind.

745
00:46:40,544 --> 00:46:42,513
l thought l'd bettertell you.

746
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:43,948
Vey thoughtful!

747
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:45,381
Vey!

748
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,053
We'll be off.

749
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:51,355
Goodnight...

750
00:46:51,355 --> 00:46:53,624
and good luck.

751
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:54,784
You too.

752
00:46:57,728 --> 00:46:59,296
Come on.
Why?

753
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:00,898
l'll explain later.

754
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:02,266
She's racist!

755
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:05,133
Get offit! She's not
racist, she's sexist.

756
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:11,541
We walked overto
St. Louis Square...

757
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:14,078
and found two lovely
little brunettes.

758
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:16,740
l even took one for myself.

759
00:47:18,282 --> 00:47:20,017
l'd been feeling tired...

760
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:22,086
and that's when
l like a brunette.

761
00:47:22,086 --> 00:47:25,356
Tall, lazy blonds
take too much work.

762
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:27,591
ln sex, practice
makes perfect.

763
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:32,363
My best lovers have always
been those who fucked the most.

764
00:47:32,363 --> 00:47:34,231
Are brunettes always best?

765
00:47:34,231 --> 00:47:38,435
lt depends. Forwinteryou want
someone big and warm.

766
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:40,471
For summer someone tender.

767
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:42,239
French girls for sparkle.

768
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:44,441
Fresh California orange juice!

769
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:47,411
And the aromas!

770
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:50,181
The Jewesses' and Arabs'
fragrance of camphor.

771
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:54,518
The Vietnamese with their
scent of orange blossoms...

772
00:47:54,518 --> 00:47:55,986
Gets me excited.

773
00:47:55,986 --> 00:47:58,455
But do they have to be pros?

774
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:01,392
lt takes longer
when they're not.

775
00:48:01,392 --> 00:48:02,793
You have to go cruising.

776
00:48:02,793 --> 00:48:04,795
lt's tonure...

777
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:08,566
hanging out in bars, paying
for dinner, dancing in discos...

778
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:10,267
You don't like dancing?

779
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:11,835
l have always...

780
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:15,372
absolutely abhorred dancing.

781
00:48:15,372 --> 00:48:18,943
The suffering l've endured
on the dance floor...

782
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:21,138
just to please women!

783
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:25,716
The worst pan is
the conversation.

784
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:29,787
''Oh, l adore
Woody Allen's films too!''

785
00:48:29,787 --> 00:48:31,488
''Did you read Shogun ?''

786
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:33,791
''Yeah, l love Bayshnikov.''

787
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,492
''Now it's Patrick Dupont.''

788
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:37,795
''Acid rain, terrible!''

789
00:48:37,795 --> 00:48:39,430
''Nuclear reactors, dreadful!''

790
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,832
''Youth unemployment, awful!''

791
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:44,468
''What's your view on
serial monogamy, Sylvie...?

792
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:45,867
Nathalie? Julie? Sophie...?''

793
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:49,529
You really have to
want to get laid!

794
00:48:54,378 --> 00:48:55,813
That's not all.

795
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:57,948
Then you have to make her come.

796
00:48:57,948 --> 00:49:00,784
No piece of cake.

797
00:49:00,784 --> 00:49:02,820
You have to find her clitoris.

798
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,988
My God!

799
00:49:03,988 --> 00:49:06,423
A delicate undenaking!

800
00:49:06,423 --> 00:49:09,560
Like looking for a
needle in a haystack.

801
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,497
You rack your brains to
recall Masters and Johnson...

802
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:16,300
Shere Hite, the Gspot debate...

803
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,202
Germaine Greer, Nancy Friday...

804
00:49:18,202 --> 00:49:21,505
Should you use your
fingers, tongue, or prick?

805
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,707
You sneak a look at her...

806
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,476
You think to yourself...

807
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:27,645
''She looks like...''

808
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:30,047
''l hope she...''

809
00:49:30,047 --> 00:49:31,582
''l wonder if...''

810
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:34,016
lt's hell, absolute hell!

811
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,655
l've never had those problems.

812
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,390
Oh no?

813
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,187
Come into my study.

814
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:49,166
The Borneo heteropteyx...

815
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:51,602
For 100 years, entomologists...

816
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:54,038
searched forthe
male of this one...

817
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:56,029
and the female of this one.

818
00:49:57,308 --> 00:49:59,843
A major issue in biology.

819
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:03,280
Until one day they
were found screwing.

820
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,249
The 2 of them.

821
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:07,484
He was the male to her.

822
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:09,486
lt seems impossible.

823
00:50:09,486 --> 00:50:10,988
She's a reptile...

824
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:13,824
and he's an insect.

825
00:50:13,824 --> 00:50:16,060
They have one thing in common.

826
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,618
What?

827
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:21,324
Fucking.

828
00:50:21,932 --> 00:50:24,196
Think about it.

829
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:34,843
Sory.

830
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:41,885
The beaches in
Sicily were desened.

831
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:45,556
He was dying of the
heat in his uniform.

832
00:50:45,556 --> 00:50:46,790
Was he a policeman?

833
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,348
A carabiniere .

834
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:51,161
So l go in.

835
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,891
l take off my
Tshin and shons...

836
00:50:55,265 --> 00:50:59,503
He stans fumbling
with his fly...

837
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:02,806
but he can't get it undone.

838
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:04,865
They're always anxious then.

839
00:51:06,076 --> 00:51:10,714
He was really wellbuilt,
shoulders broad as...

840
00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:12,116
Finally...

841
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:13,517
he drops his briefs.

842
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:16,887
The moment of truth!

843
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:19,189
His penis was...

844
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:20,884
minuscule!

845
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,730
Honestly, like a baby's!

846
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,288
Poor man.

847
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:31,268
lt was eitherthe wine...

848
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:34,638
orthe absurdity ofbeing
with a Sicilian cop...

849
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:37,007
but l burst out laughing.

850
00:51:37,007 --> 00:51:39,202
l mean, uncontrollably!

851
00:51:40,477 --> 00:51:42,308
l laughed until l wept!

852
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,879
And him?

853
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:47,985
Naturally...
it was a disaster.

854
00:51:47,985 --> 00:51:50,754
l didn't want to hun him.

855
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:53,157
He was rather sweet.

856
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:57,617
But it ended
in a complete fiasco.

857
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:05,266
l even tried my ''octopus
with suckers'' routine.

858
00:52:06,703 --> 00:52:08,227
''Suckers''?

859
00:52:09,473 --> 00:52:11,703
Well, more or less.

860
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,448
Mustn't make
fun of their penis.

861
00:52:17,448 --> 00:52:19,950
They're so preoccupied
with its size.

862
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,119
''ls his biggerthan mine?''

863
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:24,521
''Don't l got a big one?''

864
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:26,623
lt's their major preoccupation.

865
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:30,027
lt's true, they always ask.

866
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:31,551
How would you know?

867
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:34,131
Well...

868
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:36,300
it's happened.
l can understand...

869
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,102
l mean, it's pretty imponant.

870
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:42,039
How can you say that?

871
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:44,667
lf you're in love,
it's a detail.

872
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:47,578
Some detail!

873
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:50,570
l'm going to take a swim.

874
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:53,650
You've upset her.

875
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:55,586
Poor girl.

876
00:52:55,586 --> 00:52:57,781
lt's too hot, that's all.

877
00:52:59,256 --> 00:53:00,958
Worse still...

878
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:03,119
is to talk about
a former lover...

879
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,264
''Benoît could really
make me come!''

880
00:53:07,264 --> 00:53:11,166
The guy beside you
melts away like butter.

881
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,404
You can't say that!

882
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:15,873
Even more subtly...

883
00:53:15,873 --> 00:53:17,741
You pass a hotel and say...

884
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:21,378
''Benoît and l stayed here.''

885
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:24,347
Sneak a look, and
he's green with jealousy.

886
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:29,820
Orthey say, ''Before me
you didn't know what sex was.''

887
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,989
l can't stand that!

888
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:34,287
That's the time
to mention Benoît.

889
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:38,262
''lt's not the same,
darling. l love you...

890
00:53:38,262 --> 00:53:40,389
With Benoît, it was...

891
00:53:42,232 --> 00:53:44,063
purely sexual.''

892
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,229
You can feel him
turning to mush.

893
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:51,875
Orwhen he senses
you're rating him...

894
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:54,945
like for a restaurant guide.

895
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:56,113
''A bit dowdy.

896
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:59,207
Ponions somewhat stingy.''

897
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,931
Or like for...

898
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,933
a tourist guide.

899
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:18,068
''Restored mill, but...

900
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:20,468
the works are
purely decorative.''

901
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:24,875
''Charming garden but...

902
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:27,400
the fountain is dy.''

903
00:54:28,645 --> 00:54:31,842
''lmpressive manor, but
the tower is in ruins.''

904
00:54:33,483 --> 00:54:35,152
lfhe's in his 40's...

905
00:54:35,152 --> 00:54:38,986
you reminisce how young men
always wake up with hardons.

906
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,662
Oryou calmly begin
to masturbate...

907
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:48,498
after he's finished
his little number.

908
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:49,863
That always gets them.

909
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:53,236
You're terrible!

910
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:56,340
Oh, l've done worse.

911
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,433
l was with Roger
for 10 years.

912
00:54:59,776 --> 00:55:03,109
You can't imagine
what l put up with.

913
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:07,217
l was constantly left
alone with the kids.

914
00:55:07,217 --> 00:55:09,052
He'd be out cheating on me.

915
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:10,621
lt was hell.

916
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:15,217
l stayed at home,
cheerful, loyal, warm.

917
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:18,424
Till the day l'd had enough.

918
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:21,488
And all of a sudden...

919
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,323
something snapped.

920
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:30,207
Hello, Roger?

921
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,175
l'm in Brossard.

922
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:35,479
Room 216, Continental Motel.

923
00:55:35,479 --> 00:55:38,081
l'm with a friend,
having so much fun...

924
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:40,083
l think l'll spend the night.

925
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,176
l didn't want you to wory.

926
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:44,988
See you tomorrow, okay?

927
00:55:44,988 --> 00:55:47,218
Goodnight. Kiss you.

928
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:49,726
Are you crazy?

929
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:51,662
That'll teach him.

930
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:54,031
He'll come here!

931
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:55,632
Don't wory.

932
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:57,434
Don't wory!

933
00:55:57,434 --> 00:55:58,802
He's this big!

934
00:55:58,802 --> 00:56:00,203
So?

935
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:01,371
l'm not in shape!

936
00:56:01,371 --> 00:56:02,673
l'm no boxer like him!

937
00:56:02,673 --> 00:56:04,007
Scared?

938
00:56:04,007 --> 00:56:05,876
No, l'm thinking of you.

939
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:08,311
Anyway, l can't stay.

940
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:09,913
l have to get home.

941
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:11,214
He won't care.

942
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:12,549
He's violent!

943
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:13,884
l know!

944
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:15,681
He knocked out Yvan Rivard.

945
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:18,981
You slept with Yvan?

946
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:22,187
Don't forget your ring.

947
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:32,669
l always fuck my wife better
after l've cheated on her.

948
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:34,905
Guilt, that's all.

949
00:56:34,905 --> 00:56:36,907
No, it's physical.

950
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:39,176
The comparison turns me on.

951
00:56:39,176 --> 00:56:43,613
The more you screw around,
the more you want to.

952
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:47,017
To be happy,
l'd need 4 wives.

953
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:49,953
Four, exactly as the Koran says.

954
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:51,955
l'm vey happy with Louise...

955
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:55,726
but l'd also take a writer,
say Susan Sontag...

956
00:56:55,726 --> 00:56:58,595
an Olympic high jumper...

957
00:56:58,595 --> 00:57:02,224
and a real sex maniac
for group encounters.

958
00:57:50,781 --> 00:57:52,715
Looks sinfully good!

959
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:57,821
We won't mention calories.

960
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:00,857
l put on a kilo last week.

961
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:03,827
Too bad Mustafa
can't be here.

962
00:58:03,827 --> 00:58:05,862
Seems he had
otherfond memories.

963
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:07,329
Like what?

964
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:13,225
Well, l mean he must
have enjoyed his visit.

965
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:17,707
What's the sauce?
A mousseline.

966
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:19,442
But l made it with sour cream.

967
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:21,278
lt seemed more Russian.

968
00:58:21,278 --> 00:58:24,948
l heard about a course
in creative cooking.

969
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:27,617
You're not staning
with your courses again!

970
00:58:27,617 --> 00:58:28,985
Why not?

971
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:33,390
Why are women so
obsessed with taking courses?

972
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:35,125
lt's pretty obvious.

973
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:37,594
The university's
full of them...

974
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:40,797
madly taking notes on the
meaning of the Locarno Pact.

975
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:42,399
l teach those courses.

976
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:44,734
l still don't understand.

977
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:46,203
That's why...

978
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:50,473
Histoy is criticized for
dealing only with the victors.

979
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:53,643
Often this is due to
the documents available.

980
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:59,216
There are more records about
Egyptians than Nubians...

981
00:58:59,216 --> 00:59:03,119
more about Spaniards
than Mayas...

982
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,351
and of course, many more
records about men than women.

983
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:11,889
This limitation to
Histoy is vey real.

984
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:16,533
There is perhaps also
a psychological reason.

985
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:20,237
We far prefer hearing
about winners...

986
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:22,467
than about losers.

987
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:27,777
l don't mean your courses...

988
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:32,582
But what is it about
studying German, the guitar...

989
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:34,517
Tap dancing...
Shiatsu...

990
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:35,950
Primal therapy...

991
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:38,955
Nothing personal.

992
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:41,124
Seems obvious.

993
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:42,459
Not to me.

994
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:45,762
Except for a pathological need
to have teachers, gurus...

995
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:47,430
That's not it!

996
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,934
lt's a way ofbreaking out.

997
00:59:50,934 --> 00:59:52,168
You can't understand,

998
00:59:52,168 --> 00:59:54,659
you got your Ph.D. at 26.

999
00:59:55,805 --> 00:59:57,407
When we were studying...

1000
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:00,110
l was evey bit as
sman as the rest of you.

1001
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:03,313
But l fell in love, like
a woman is supposed to.

1002
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:06,883
So while you were at Berkeley,
and Pierre at Princeton...

1003
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:12,255
l rotted in the county 'cause
Rogerwas on his nature trip.

1004
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:14,491
You seemed happy enough.

1005
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:15,825
l was happy.

1006
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:19,696
l had kids, but instead
of studying demography...

1007
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:22,028
l learned how to make jam.

1008
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:25,268
Now l have to work as a TA...

1009
01:00:25,268 --> 01:00:28,505
at one fifth your salay,
and without job security.

1010
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:32,142
l'm not covered by the best
contract in Nonh America.

1011
01:00:32,142 --> 01:00:34,444
l can't take...

1012
01:00:34,444 --> 01:00:36,776
a years sabbatical in Brazil.

1013
01:00:38,515 --> 01:00:40,517
l have to do radio interviews...

1014
01:00:40,517 --> 01:00:43,219
to send my kids
to private school.

1015
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:45,084
l'll never have tenure.

1016
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:52,462
l'm getting old.

1017
01:00:52,462 --> 01:00:56,626
l can't read and take
notes for 5 hours straight.

1018
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,870
My memoy's going too.

1019
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:08,275
l had to referto the
KelloggBriand Pact.

1020
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:11,715
l couldn't remember Briand...

1021
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:14,517
only the name of the cereal...

1022
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:16,576
Kellogg's Corn Flakes.

1023
01:01:20,023 --> 01:01:22,958
That's not age, it's drugs!

1024
01:01:24,094 --> 01:01:25,994
You're an old hippy.

1025
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:29,760
l'll bet you remember
Souvanna Phouma!

1026
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:33,069
And Souphanouvong!
And?

1027
01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:35,629
Phoumi Nosavan!

1028
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,708
What's that?

1029
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:41,778
Laotian politicians 2
halfbrothers and a cousin.

1030
01:01:41,778 --> 01:01:45,148
The scourge of
contemporay histoy exams.

1031
01:01:45,148 --> 01:01:47,946
Worse than SchleswigHolstein.

1032
01:01:47,984 --> 01:01:55,481
You never really know how
you should lead your life.

1033
01:01:55,525 --> 01:01:58,962
So your kids got in
the way of your Ph.D....

1034
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:00,764
but they're yours.

1035
01:02:00,764 --> 01:02:03,392
That' s something to treasure.

1036
01:02:09,205 --> 01:02:10,640
Who's that?

1037
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,908
Afriend of mommy's.

1038
01:02:11,908 --> 01:02:13,376
What's he doing there?

1039
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:14,844
Sleeping.

1040
01:02:14,844 --> 01:02:17,711
l want him to go!

1041
01:02:19,682 --> 01:02:21,309
l'm going.

1042
01:02:24,587 --> 01:02:26,714
l always wanted a child.

1043
01:02:30,293 --> 01:02:32,562
Children are life...

1044
01:02:32,562 --> 01:02:34,964
an affirmation oflife.

1045
01:02:34,964 --> 01:02:38,735
l was going to adopt
a Cambodian child.

1046
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:42,671
A social worker had
to evaluate me, so...

1047
01:02:44,507 --> 01:02:47,010
Betterto have
kids who love you...

1048
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:48,812
than to end up like Pierre...

1049
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:52,248
alone, bitter,
without any family.

1050
01:02:52,248 --> 01:02:54,512
But l do have a family.

1051
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,345
Here, sitting around this table.

1052
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:06,763
l feel closerto this family...
than to my brother

1053
01:03:06,763 --> 01:03:07,997
the insurance broker...

1054
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:09,632
or my parents...

1055
01:03:09,632 --> 01:03:13,336
who could neverfigure me out...

1056
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:15,827
and complain 'cause
l don't go to mass.

1057
01:03:18,641 --> 01:03:20,443
You're my family.

1058
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:22,979
I Someone knocks at the door ]

1059
01:03:22,979 --> 01:03:24,970
Who can that be?

1060
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:28,373
Are we expecting anyone?

1061
01:03:38,428 --> 01:03:40,623
Diane, it's foryou.

1062
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:44,524
He was here earlier.

1063
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:57,637
l never see anyone
outside the depanment.

1064
01:03:59,215 --> 01:04:01,149
l'm like you.

1065
01:04:08,725 --> 01:04:10,386
Take off your glasses.

1066
01:04:19,936 --> 01:04:22,739
Mario, you haven't
met Dominique...

1067
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:24,174
Louise...
Hello Mario.

1068
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:26,836
...and Danielle.

1069
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:31,143
l'll get you a chair.

1070
01:04:45,862 --> 01:04:48,231
Would you like some coulibiac?

1071
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:49,899
Some what?

1072
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:53,836
lt's a salmon pie, but l
used trout instead of salmon.

1073
01:04:53,836 --> 01:04:56,539
lt's good,
it's a Russian recipe.

1074
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:58,675
l don't like fish.

1075
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:01,644
Would you like some
Stilton cheese?

1076
01:05:01,644 --> 01:05:02,906
l'm not hungy.

1077
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:04,614
But you didn't eat.

1078
01:05:04,614 --> 01:05:07,811
Have some wine at least.

1079
01:05:09,219 --> 01:05:10,811
Got any beer?

1080
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:23,996
Do you live around here?

1081
01:05:25,134 --> 01:05:26,396
Talking to me?

1082
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:30,872
Are you from the area?

1083
01:05:45,455 --> 01:05:48,524
You may be wrong about
my getting old alone.

1084
01:05:48,524 --> 01:05:50,026
l probably won't make it.

1085
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:51,427
There's lung cancer...

1086
01:05:51,427 --> 01:05:53,529
hean attacks...

1087
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:55,732
Women live to old age, not men.

1088
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:57,967
lsn't that levelling out?

1089
01:05:57,967 --> 01:05:59,702
Just the opposite.

1090
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:03,172
Women's life expectancy is 78.

1091
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,341
For men it's 70.

1092
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:07,036
The gap keeps widening.

1093
01:06:07,076 --> 01:06:10,947
That's the crucial
change in our lives.

1094
01:06:10,947 --> 01:06:13,316
Less than 200 years ago...

1095
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:16,552
women lived to about 36.

1096
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:18,955
Not a long life.

1097
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:23,092
The records are full
of widows and widowers...

1098
01:06:23,092 --> 01:06:25,328
orphans and stepchildren.

1099
01:06:25,328 --> 01:06:28,765
That's all vanished
in less than a centuy.

1100
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:30,933
What's with this beer?

1101
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:33,503
lt's imponed Pilsner.

1102
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:35,538
You like this?

1103
01:06:35,538 --> 01:06:38,098
Occasionally.

1104
01:06:40,877 --> 01:06:42,811
Think about it, marriages...

1105
01:06:43,279 --> 01:06:46,049
lasted an average of 15 years.

1106
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:48,818
We've been married 15 years.

1107
01:06:48,818 --> 01:06:51,821
Five generations back
it would all be over.

1108
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:53,948
One of you would be dead.

1109
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:57,617
You should write
a paper on that.

1110
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:03,499
17,000 scholarly anicles
are published evey day.

1111
01:07:03,499 --> 01:07:05,068
One more or less...

1112
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:06,969
l've had enough of this.

1113
01:07:06,969 --> 01:07:08,771
We're still eating.

1114
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:10,506
This is a drag.

1115
01:07:10,506 --> 01:07:12,371
We're talking.

1116
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:15,508
lntellectuals love to talk.

1117
01:07:15,545 --> 01:07:18,448
All you do is talk.

1118
01:07:18,448 --> 01:07:21,017
All afternoon they
went on about sex.

1119
01:07:21,017 --> 01:07:22,814
l expected an orgy.

1120
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:25,844
lnstead, the big
thrill is a fish pie.

1121
01:07:27,924 --> 01:07:30,159
What are you suggesting?

1122
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:32,795
When l'm horny, l fuck.

1123
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:34,097
What d'you say?

1124
01:07:34,097 --> 01:07:36,199
Mario, please.

1125
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:38,190
Well, how 'bout it?

1126
01:07:44,307 --> 01:07:46,275
l'll be outside.

1127
01:08:01,824 --> 01:08:06,022
lt was delicious,
but l'm not hungy.

1128
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:11,257
Excuse me.

1129
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,408
l didn't think she
was that far gone.

1130
01:08:47,203 --> 01:08:49,535
People should speak about...
what they know, that's it.

1131
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,809
The Pope knows all about...

1132
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:55,645
masturbation and
prostate ailments.

1133
01:08:55,645 --> 01:08:57,510
He can talk about that.

1134
01:08:59,215 --> 01:09:00,450
Banking too.

1135
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,681
And the ClA. Don't
underestimate the Pope.

1136
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:10,026
Marx was your average
middleclass German...

1137
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:14,464
who fucked the maid
behind his wife's back.

1138
01:09:14,464 --> 01:09:19,094
His theories are rooted
in his sense of guilt.

1139
01:09:20,736 --> 01:09:22,605
Same for Freud.

1140
01:09:22,605 --> 01:09:25,107
A latent homosexual...

1141
01:09:25,107 --> 01:09:27,944
unable to lay his
wife after age 40...

1142
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:30,913
hot and bothered over
his female patients.

1143
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:33,483
His quarrels with Jung...

1144
01:09:33,483 --> 01:09:36,352
were really about women...

1145
01:09:36,352 --> 01:09:38,013
about sex.

1146
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:44,694
l get a kick out of eminent...

1147
01:09:44,694 --> 01:09:46,596
sociologists
and psychologists...

1148
01:09:46,596 --> 01:09:50,366
who spew fonh
theories of sexuality...

1149
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:52,068
when l've seen them...

1150
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:56,334
being flogged with wet
towels in a massage parlour.

1151
01:09:57,473 --> 01:09:59,342
You go to places like that?

1152
01:09:59,342 --> 01:10:01,277
Sure.

1153
01:10:01,277 --> 01:10:02,645
Often?

1154
01:10:02,645 --> 01:10:04,313
Yeah.

1155
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,182
How do you feel about it?

1156
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:08,584
How l feel?

1157
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:11,254
Well, l mean...

1158
01:10:11,254 --> 01:10:13,823
ifl everfound out
Rémy had been to one...

1159
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:15,825
l'd neverforgive him.

1160
01:10:15,825 --> 01:10:17,593
Why not?

1161
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:19,996
He's got me.

1162
01:10:19,996 --> 01:10:23,261
lfhe wants a massage,
l'll be happy to give him one.

1163
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:26,762
l don't go to those places.

1164
01:10:28,004 --> 01:10:30,039
That's no surprise.

1165
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:31,207
What do you mean?

1166
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:35,177
Want me to describe
a female fantasy?

1167
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:36,838
The female fantasy?

1168
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:40,883
The woman is at home...

1169
01:10:40,883 --> 01:10:43,819
in the nest she has
so lovingly decorated...

1170
01:10:43,819 --> 01:10:46,722
her husband or lover arrives.

1171
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:50,059
He's brought flowers
and a bottle of champagne.

1172
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:52,721
He is extremely nice.

1173
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:57,156
They spend a pleasant evening...

1174
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,702
and make love.

1175
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:01,397
End of fantasy.

1176
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,299
What a bore!

1177
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:10,479
Whenever he
talks about love...

1178
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,215
he makes it seem ridiculous.

1179
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:15,518
But Pierre...

1180
01:11:15,518 --> 01:11:19,255
don't you realize the
lives those poorwomen lead?

1181
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:21,824
How they're forced
to work there?

1182
01:11:21,824 --> 01:11:23,659
You might as well be a rapist.

1183
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:25,628
lt's just as bad.

1184
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:28,864
Those poor girls...
they need help.

1185
01:11:28,864 --> 01:11:30,132
How do you know?

1186
01:11:30,132 --> 01:11:33,101
l've seen stories on them.

1187
01:11:35,871 --> 01:11:37,840
Thursday afternoon l can't.

1188
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,911
l'll miss
''Demographic Methodology''.

1189
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:44,213
What about after?

1190
01:11:44,213 --> 01:11:48,884
l was hoping to take
''Statistics and the Computer''.

1191
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:52,388
Be reasonable,
Thursday's our busiest day.

1192
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:56,392
Manon can't get a sitter
and Carole's husband is home.

1193
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:58,060
What'll l do?

1194
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:01,664
lfl miss that course
l'll never be able to keep up.

1195
01:12:01,664 --> 01:12:03,188
We'll see.

1196
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:15,945
lt's been a while.

1197
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:18,247
lt's end of term.

1198
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:21,651
l'm up to my neck
in corrections.

1199
01:12:21,651 --> 01:12:23,486
You need a good massage.

1200
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:24,987
With shower?

1201
01:12:24,987 --> 01:12:26,689
Yeah.

1202
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:31,661
This afternoon l have
Miss Kim, Miss Sandra...

1203
01:12:31,661 --> 01:12:33,219
and Miss Susan.

1204
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:37,133
A new girl.

1205
01:12:37,133 --> 01:12:39,001
She only works pan time.

1206
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:41,003
Vey well liked.

1207
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:42,938
l recommend her.

1208
01:12:42,938 --> 01:12:45,532
Alright, l'll take yourword.

1209
01:12:47,943 --> 01:12:52,505
One regularwith shower.

1210
01:12:54,016 --> 01:12:55,251
Coming .

1211
01:12:55,251 --> 01:12:56,843
lt won't be long.

1212
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:06,856
This way.

1213
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:12,264
See you later.

1214
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:27,750
You work pan time?

1215
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,151
Yeah, l'm a student.

1216
01:13:29,151 --> 01:13:30,386
What are you in?

1217
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:31,853
Histoy.

1218
01:13:33,723 --> 01:13:35,491
At the university?

1219
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:38,358
Yeah, my first semester.

1220
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:42,665
People go on about how
we live in a violent society.

1221
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:44,462
lt comes up on TV all the time.

1222
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:54,643
From a historical perspective,
that's just not true.

1223
01:13:54,643 --> 01:13:56,611
lt's a relatively peaceful age.

1224
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:00,376
Yourtowel?

1225
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:10,326
Your glasses?

1226
01:14:10,326 --> 01:14:11,850
What?

1227
01:14:22,371 --> 01:14:27,143
Reponers get all worked up
because of 10% unemployment.

1228
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:29,612
When we think about
London back in 1850

1229
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:31,747
having a population of millions

1230
01:14:31,747 --> 01:14:35,012
600,000 people were
literally starving to death.

1231
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:43,757
That's what l like about
histoy, it's so reassuring.

1232
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:49,965
Papers finished?

1233
01:14:49,965 --> 01:14:53,202
l still have one
in Mediaeval Histoy.

1234
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:55,137
What's your subject?

1235
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:56,934
Millenniarism.

1236
01:14:56,972 --> 01:15:00,772
l'm fascinated by all
the talk about the year 2000.

1237
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:05,842
Do you want the special?

1238
01:15:09,552 --> 01:15:10,686
Yeah.

1239
01:15:10,686 --> 01:15:11,887
The price is...

1240
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:15,891
25$ for manual, 40$ for oral.
l don't go funher.

1241
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:17,756
Let's make it by hand.

1242
01:15:19,195 --> 01:15:20,462
Should l pay now?

1243
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:21,622
No, after.

1244
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:25,100
That's why the year
1000 interests me.

1245
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:27,136
ln Europe, it was a major event.

1246
01:15:27,136 --> 01:15:32,508
People believed that on
Januay 1 of the year 1000,

1247
01:15:32,508 --> 01:15:34,243
the world would end.

1248
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:36,612
Gabriel's trumpet...

1249
01:15:36,612 --> 01:15:41,617
the Four Horsemen, the
Last Judgement, the whole bit.

1250
01:15:41,617 --> 01:15:43,812
God, l forgot to
take off my robe.

1251
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:45,921
l'm not vey sexy.

1252
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,549
You're just fine.

1253
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:52,094
The churches were packed.

1254
01:15:52,094 --> 01:15:56,599
People sold their houses and
gave their money to the poor.

1255
01:15:56,599 --> 01:15:59,935
Others whipped themselves
during public processions.

1256
01:15:59,935 --> 01:16:01,070
Some even...

1257
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:04,198
kissed lepers and
licked their sores.

1258
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:07,142
What interests me...

1259
01:16:07,142 --> 01:16:09,111
Excuse me...

1260
01:16:09,111 --> 01:16:10,779
l'm about to come.

1261
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:11,947
Oh, sory.

1262
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:13,710
l talk too much.

1263
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:28,786
Thank you, Miss.

1264
01:16:31,233 --> 01:16:32,928
My pleasure, Sir.

1265
01:16:37,473 --> 01:16:40,309
That's when it happened.

1266
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:43,345
l fell head over heels in love.

1267
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:46,916
Ejaculating while
discussing the millennium...

1268
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:51,080
was intellectually and
physically overwhelming.

1269
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:01,030
Signs of the empire's
decline are everywhere.

1270
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:05,768
Society despises
its own institutions...

1271
01:17:05,768 --> 01:17:07,369
the binh rate keeps dropping...

1272
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:09,338
men refuse to serve
in the army...

1273
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:12,708
the national debt
is out of control...

1274
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:15,878
the work week is
getting shoner...

1275
01:17:15,878 --> 01:17:19,746
the bureaucracies are rampant...
the elites are in decay...

1276
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:25,220
With the collapse of
the MarxistLeninist dream...

1277
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,122
and model exists...

1278
01:17:27,122 --> 01:17:29,258
of which we can say...

1279
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:31,192
''This is how we want to live.''

1280
01:17:33,062 --> 01:17:35,230
ln our personal lives...

1281
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:37,866
unless one is a
mystic or a saint...

1282
01:17:37,866 --> 01:17:42,538
there are no models to live by.

1283
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:47,339
Our vey existence
is being eroded.

1284
01:18:04,393 --> 01:18:07,329
And you believe this
process is inevitable?

1285
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:08,831
Yes, absolutely.

1286
01:18:08,831 --> 01:18:12,534
Though there will always
be charlatans claiming...

1287
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:15,571
salvation lies
in communications...

1288
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:19,375
microchips, the return
to religion, physical fitness...

1289
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:22,111
or some other idiocy.

1290
01:18:22,111 --> 01:18:27,583
A civilization's decline
is as inevitable as old age.

1291
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,953
We can ty to slow
down the process.

1292
01:18:30,953 --> 01:18:32,755
That's all.

1293
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:37,158
We're fonunate here to be
on the outskins of the empire.

1294
01:18:37,793 --> 01:18:39,828
The shocks are less violent.

1295
01:18:39,828 --> 01:18:42,364
Life in these times...

1296
01:18:42,364 --> 01:18:44,700
can be vey pleasant
in some respects.

1297
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,101
Anyway...

1298
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:51,095
our mindset precludes
any otherform of experience.

1299
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:55,010
Few of us would be able...

1300
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:58,605
to live among the Puritans
ofNew England in the 1650's.

1301
01:19:00,716 --> 01:19:03,446
Thank you, Dominique StArnaud.

1302
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:07,647
That was cheerful.

1303
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:13,488
Well, l don't agree.

1304
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:20,335
l'm sure there are expens who
can prove just the opposite...

1305
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:24,640
that we're living in an
age ofincredible rebinh...

1306
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,509
that science has never
progressed so fast...

1307
01:19:27,509 --> 01:19:29,945
that life has never been better.

1308
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:34,349
lt's impossible to understand
the age you live in.

1309
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:38,120
All you can do is
ty to be happy.

1310
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,222
That's what people
have always wanted.

1311
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:44,226
The rest invent theories
to justify their misey.

1312
01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:46,328
You said so yourself.

1313
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:49,565
Just because you choose...

1314
01:19:49,565 --> 01:19:51,967
to live all alone...

1315
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:54,436
and sacrifice your
life to a career...

1316
01:19:54,436 --> 01:19:57,172
doesn't mean that
ifl'm lucid...

1317
01:19:57,172 --> 01:19:59,163
l have to be depressed.

1318
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:11,386
You haven't said a
word about the book.

1319
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:16,625
l bet they agree with me
but are scared to say so.

1320
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:20,755
l think they feel superior.

1321
01:20:21,997 --> 01:20:23,430
Superior? Why?

1322
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:29,932
Because you've
both slept with me.

1323
01:20:48,357 --> 01:20:51,493
What does that
have to do with it?

1324
01:20:51,493 --> 01:20:55,063
l think that
for men like you...

1325
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:57,896
love always entails
a struggle for power.

1326
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:03,605
Rémy's often said he'd like
to seduce a big intellectual...

1327
01:21:03,605 --> 01:21:05,240
l don't know, say...

1328
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,675
Susan Sontag.

1329
01:21:06,675 --> 01:21:09,235
Right.

1330
01:21:09,311 --> 01:21:11,413
lt's the urge
to appropriate her.

1331
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:15,440
To dominate her,
almost physically.

1332
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:18,654
Come on...

1333
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:22,454
it can also be the desire
to share, to be with...

1334
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:24,760
Perhaps...

1335
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:30,065
but l can't trust the disdain
of men who've made me come...

1336
01:21:30,065 --> 01:21:32,158
who've ''had'' me.

1337
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:35,804
Well, who knows...

1338
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:38,364
l may be wrong.

1339
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:01,563
l've always wondered...

1340
01:22:01,563 --> 01:22:04,967
Would we see the missiles
in a nuclearwar?

1341
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:07,603
No, they'd be too high.

1342
01:22:07,603 --> 01:22:10,072
But when they stan to fall?

1343
01:22:10,072 --> 01:22:13,976
The missiles don't
fall, just the bombs.

1344
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:16,178
And they're small.

1345
01:22:16,178 --> 01:22:19,748
Would we see the
explosions in the US?

1346
01:22:19,748 --> 01:22:24,014
lf Plattsburgh were hit...
we'd probably see the fireball.

1347
01:22:31,827 --> 01:22:34,229
Do you have any valium?

1348
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:37,596
l don't think so,
but we'll get you something.

1349
01:22:46,074 --> 01:22:48,844
l was taking too much
valium, l had to stop.

1350
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:50,612
There's librium.

1351
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:52,614
Anything else?

1352
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:54,650
l've got Mogadons and Sorpax.

1353
01:22:54,650 --> 01:22:57,050
l'll take 2.

1354
01:23:16,605 --> 01:23:18,800
lt's hit you hard, eh?

1355
01:23:27,182 --> 01:23:29,384
l'd like to have
a baby with you.

1356
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:30,786
To remind me...

1357
01:23:30,786 --> 01:23:32,413
For later.

1358
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:38,026
You have to like
yourself to procreate.

1359
01:23:38,026 --> 01:23:40,562
l don't.

1360
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:42,331
l'm not optimistic enough.

1361
01:23:42,331 --> 01:23:44,128
You'd be a good father.

1362
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:49,104
lntellectuals rarely
make good parents.

1363
01:23:49,104 --> 01:23:52,040
Think of Diane's
kids, or Rémy's.

1364
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,530
Disasters.

1365
01:23:54,309 --> 01:23:56,144
And l'm too selfish.

1366
01:23:56,144 --> 01:23:58,580
Having to listen
to heavy metal...

1367
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,016
when l'm reading...

1368
01:24:01,016 --> 01:24:02,918
You are going
to grow old alone.

1369
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:04,943
Having kids won't change that.

1370
01:24:06,154 --> 01:24:08,190
They'd put me in a home...

1371
01:24:08,190 --> 01:24:12,286
and resent having to
visit me at Christmas.

1372
01:24:14,396 --> 01:24:15,761
l love you.

1373
01:24:16,898 --> 01:24:18,866
l love you too.

1374
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:29,211
Want to make love?

1375
01:24:29,211 --> 01:24:30,735
l'm too tired.

1376
01:24:34,716 --> 01:24:38,387
You'll have to ask
some kid, like Alain.

1377
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:41,223
He can't hope for better.

1378
01:24:41,223 --> 01:24:44,989
l want to make love
to you, you old fool.

1379
01:24:45,093 --> 01:24:46,828
You never understand.

1380
01:24:46,828 --> 01:24:49,558
l know you're
just after my body.

1381
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,926
You can hardly get it up!

1382
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:55,070
l love you, tubby.

1383
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:56,805
Me too, you're real lucky.

1384
01:24:56,805 --> 01:24:58,432
Don't l know.

1385
01:25:02,544 --> 01:25:03,745
Scotch?

1386
01:25:03,745 --> 01:25:06,181
No, l don't like it.

1387
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:08,316
Too bad.

1388
01:25:08,316 --> 01:25:10,118
Why did you do it?

1389
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:11,319
What?

1390
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:13,651
Tell Louise
about you and Rémy.

1391
01:25:15,424 --> 01:25:17,551
lt just slipped out.

1392
01:25:21,096 --> 01:25:22,731
l wanted to get back at her.

1393
01:25:22,731 --> 01:25:24,323
Why?

1394
01:25:26,101 --> 01:25:27,602
l don't know.

1395
01:25:27,602 --> 01:25:29,838
lt just came over me.

1396
01:25:29,838 --> 01:25:31,931
lt's not like you.

1397
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:35,544
You're always so calm...

1398
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:37,512
so cheerful.

1399
01:25:37,512 --> 01:25:39,915
l've never seen you
lose your patience.

1400
01:25:39,915 --> 01:25:42,617
lt's one thing
l can't stomach.

1401
01:25:42,617 --> 01:25:44,119
What?

1402
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:45,484
Blindness.

1403
01:25:46,955 --> 01:25:49,788
People who are
unable to see reality.

1404
01:25:54,329 --> 01:25:56,264
Talk to me.

1405
01:25:56,264 --> 01:25:57,566
Tomorrow.

1406
01:25:57,566 --> 01:25:59,761
What went on with Dominique?

1407
01:26:01,903 --> 01:26:03,427
Nothing.

1408
01:26:04,806 --> 01:26:06,569
That's not what she said.

1409
01:26:10,278 --> 01:26:12,180
Can we talk
about it tomorrow?

1410
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:14,478
ljust took Sorpax.

1411
01:26:22,057 --> 01:26:24,389
Talk to me.

1412
01:26:30,999 --> 01:26:32,967
Don't cy.

1413
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:37,101
lt's not wonh cying over.

1414
01:26:43,879 --> 01:26:47,449
ljust can't take these
middleclass housewives...

1415
01:26:47,449 --> 01:26:50,816
with their cute
husbands and cute kids.

1416
01:26:53,021 --> 01:26:56,923
l've watched so many men
getting dressed at 2 am.

1417
01:26:59,995 --> 01:27:02,364
Still, Rémy's special...

1418
01:27:02,364 --> 01:27:04,766
he's screwed all Montréal.

1419
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:07,997
He says he's like the
Red Cross, a universal donor.

1420
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:11,632
Two years he slept with Diane.

1421
01:27:12,307 --> 01:27:13,975
Oh yeah?
With Diane?

1422
01:27:13,975 --> 01:27:15,410
Yup.

1423
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:17,312
Anyone in a skin at school...

1424
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:19,780
down to the last secretay.

1425
01:27:21,249 --> 01:27:23,240
And then there
are all the others.

1426
01:27:27,022 --> 01:27:29,724
He told me he laid
Louise's sister...

1427
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:31,749
and really got off on it.

1428
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:36,531
But he's not that handsome.

1429
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:38,633
Doesn't mean a thing.

1430
01:27:38,633 --> 01:27:40,101
He loves sex.

1431
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:42,337
That's irresistible.

1432
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:44,999
So many men don't
really enjoy it.

1433
01:27:54,316 --> 01:27:56,113
I Someone knocks at the door ]

1434
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:17,004
Please take me in your arms.

1435
01:29:32,547 --> 01:29:37,041
lf only you knew how much
that calm look costs me.

1436
01:29:38,787 --> 01:29:41,790
Evey morning l
wake up in a rage.

1437
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:43,121
What about?

1438
01:29:45,026 --> 01:29:46,857
Anything,
nothing, everything.

1439
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:52,066
lt takes two cups of
coffee to hold me together.

1440
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:26,494
There are painters of
the night like Rembrandt...

1441
01:31:26,494 --> 01:31:29,230
or Georges De La Tour...

1442
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:31,892
but there are few
who paint the dawn.

1443
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:36,671
Dawn is the hour of death...

1444
01:31:36,671 --> 01:31:39,265
the hour of seagrey light.

1445
01:31:41,109 --> 01:31:43,745
There is Géricault...

1446
01:31:43,745 --> 01:31:46,737
and above all Caravaggio.

1447
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:26,520
l brought you something.

1448
01:32:40,468 --> 01:32:42,402
Hope you like it.

1449
01:33:11,099 --> 01:33:12,396
Rough night?

1450
01:33:13,401 --> 01:33:15,596
The way l like'em.

1451
01:33:33,321 --> 01:33:35,890
There was blood
in my urine again.

1452
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:37,258
A lot?

1453
01:33:37,258 --> 01:33:39,560
The bowl was full.

1454
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,362
lt's been like
that for a week.

1455
01:33:41,362 --> 01:33:43,031
What is it?

1456
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:45,133
They don't know yet.

1457
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:47,260
God, you're soaking.

1458
01:33:53,207 --> 01:33:54,475
Come and eat.

1459
01:33:54,475 --> 01:33:56,477
Bacon and eggs
those l can handle.

1460
01:33:56,477 --> 01:33:58,579
You seem chipper.

1461
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:00,615
County air...

1462
01:34:00,615 --> 01:34:03,083
does me good.

1463
01:34:09,557 --> 01:34:14,195
Dominique, Diane, Claude will
always be alone, abandoned...

1464
01:34:14,195 --> 01:34:17,966
Pierre and Danielle won't
last more than a year.

1465
01:34:17,966 --> 01:34:20,628
We've been together 20 years.

1466
01:34:24,472 --> 01:34:26,574
That's what love is.

1467
01:34:26,574 --> 01:34:30,101
lt lasts, it can overcome
a child's illness, or old age.

1468
01:34:32,814 --> 01:34:36,351
lt's you l want to sleep with...

1469
01:34:36,351 --> 01:34:37,585
the rest of my life.

1470
01:34:37,585 --> 01:34:40,076
l love you so much.

1471
01:34:48,162 --> 01:34:49,857
Shit!

1472
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,602
Need help?

1473
01:34:54,602 --> 01:34:56,070
Yeah, maybe.

1474
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:57,867
Let me.

1475
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:04,479
Can l see you again?

1476
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:05,880
Of course.

1477
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:08,216
Why do you ask?

1478
01:35:08,216 --> 01:35:10,184
l dunno.

1479
01:35:10,184 --> 01:35:13,621
l never know what
you really mean.

1480
01:35:13,621 --> 01:35:16,357
Words are cheap, baby.

1481
01:35:16,357 --> 01:35:18,359
What's that?

1482
01:35:18,359 --> 01:35:20,228
Don't listen to me...

1483
01:35:20,228 --> 01:35:21,996
touch me.

1484
01:35:21,996 --> 01:35:23,930
Touch me, baby.

1485
01:35:31,506 --> 01:35:35,476
...like when Roben Turmel
returned from Venice...

1486
01:35:35,476 --> 01:35:37,111
l know, l was with him.

1487
01:35:37,111 --> 01:35:38,546
Oh yeah.

1488
01:35:38,546 --> 01:35:42,016
So you heard about his
hot affairwith an ltalian.

1489
01:35:42,016 --> 01:35:44,052
Come on, he spent one night...

1490
01:35:44,052 --> 01:35:47,055
with Monica Massaferro,
the Pollaiuolos specialist...

1491
01:35:47,055 --> 01:35:50,324
His wife said it was
more than one night.

1492
01:35:50,324 --> 01:35:52,293
One night, he told me so.

1493
01:35:52,293 --> 01:35:54,796
Anyway, when he got back,

1494
01:35:54,796 --> 01:35:56,230
he told his wife...

1495
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:57,698
He didn't tell her!

1496
01:35:57,698 --> 01:35:59,634
But l got this from her!

1497
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:00,935
He should know.

1498
01:36:00,935 --> 01:36:03,233
Dominique can settle this.

1499
01:36:04,906 --> 01:36:08,776
What did Roben tell his wife
when he got back from ltaly?

1500
01:36:08,776 --> 01:36:10,912
All he said was
he had an affair.

1501
01:36:10,912 --> 01:36:14,515
The way l heard it, just
as he was about to confess...

1502
01:36:14,515 --> 01:36:16,984
his wife told him
she had an affair.

1503
01:36:16,984 --> 01:36:18,619
He was shattered.

1504
01:36:18,619 --> 01:36:20,922
His wife never said that!

1505
01:36:20,922 --> 01:36:22,957
No, it's impossible.

1506
01:36:22,957 --> 01:36:26,761
His wife probably
suspected something.

1507
01:36:26,761 --> 01:36:27,862
No she didn't.

1508
01:36:27,862 --> 01:36:29,263
lf she'd suspected...

1509
01:36:29,263 --> 01:36:30,932
You can sense these things.

1510
01:36:30,932 --> 01:36:33,835
No, he sensed her uneasiness.

1511
01:36:33,835 --> 01:36:35,636
l know Roben vey well.

1512
01:36:35,636 --> 01:36:37,338
He wouldn't lie to me.

1513
01:36:37,338 --> 01:36:39,040
One of them is lying.

1514
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,242
l tend to believe his wife.

1515
01:36:41,242 --> 01:36:43,111
Me too, when it comes to that.

1516
01:36:43,111 --> 01:36:45,279
He is vey sensitive.

1517
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:47,181
You mean touchy.

1518
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:48,739
You think he's touchy?

1519
01:36:56,591 --> 01:36:58,058
Come help.

1520
01:37:04,932 --> 01:37:06,763
ls that it?

1521
01:37:07,268 --> 01:37:09,437
Do you still give lessons?

1522
01:37:09,437 --> 01:37:11,371
Two afternoons...

1523
01:37:11,472 --> 01:37:13,407
lt's tough with the kids.

1524
01:37:13,407 --> 01:37:15,136
You could get a sitter.

1525
01:37:47,942 --> 01:37:50,069
l swearthat's what happened.

1526
01:37:51,746 --> 01:37:54,715
l guess we'll never
really know for sure.

1527
01:38:34,522 --> 01:38:35,990
You okay?

1528
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:37,457
Yeah.
